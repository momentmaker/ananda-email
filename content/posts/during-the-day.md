We are often asked, “How can I keep the peace and joy I feel in meditation during the demands and distractions of daily activity?” This is, in fact, one of life’s ever-present tests. Another way of phrasing this question is, “How can I keep my energy flowing in a positive direction, in tune with my higher aspirations, so that the world does not pull me down?”

Here are some solutions to this great challenge:

# During Activity

Since we must act, let us do our best to act properly. What constitutes proper action? We can learn much from the example of great teachers such as Patanjali, Jesus, and Buddha. Indeed, the essence of all spiritual teaching is that we should act in attunement with God or His saints.

If you are unsure about a contemplated course of action, just ask, “Will this move me toward God or away from Him (or Her)?” The mere act of asking that question is half the battle. If we but ask, we will often feel an inward guidance.

Here are some suggestions for when we are busily engaged.

**Pray to God during the day:** before meals, before work, before interacting with others. It only takes a moment, and will keep the spotlight of your mind turned toward your higher Self.

**Control what you can:** Make sure that the music you listen to is uplifting. A market owner was plagued by rough characters hanging around in his parking lot. His solution was brilliant. He played classical music through loudspeakers; they couldn’t stand the uplifting vibrations, and left.

**The same is true for the rough characters that inhabit the darker recesses of our mind. Drive them away with good vibrations.** Keep your environment clean and colors pure. With the movies you watch or books you read, imagine that God is sitting beside you, because He is. Choose your companions wisely; good company is vital.

**Use the breath to calm the mind.** Before or during tense situations, keep your posture erect and take a few deep, slow breaths. It will both center your mind and give you space to act rather than react.

# During Idle Moments

We have many times during the day when we are not engaged: between tasks, waiting in line, riding in a car. These are precious moments. The goal at these times is to practice the presence of God, conversing with Him as you would with a close friend.

Some specific suggestions:

- Chant inwardly or repeat a mantra.

- Watch the breath—you can even practice Hong-Sau.

- Pray for those around you, or give them a smile and some positive energy.

- Remind yourself that everyone and everything you are seeing is God alone. As you gaze about, repeat to yourself, “I see only Thee, Lord.”

- Perhaps most important of all, remember to relax and enjoy the day. Life is a long and winding road, and if we don’t enjoy the ride we will end up grim and bitter.

# When You’re Able to Withdraw

Finally, there are times during the day when we are able to be completely still. The goal during these times is to retract the life force, bringing it inward and upward. We recently read this very powerful practice recommended by Yogananda: “The great work now before you is to practice going up and down the spine, chanting Aum at each center. In that way you will gain more than by reading all the books—practice going up and down the spine and get acquainted with those currents.”

Often during the day you cannot control what is happening around you, but you can always control yourself. It is not difficult to practice any of these suggestions. The great challenge is to remember to do so during a busy day. If you forget, don’t despair. To paraphrase Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, “Even a little practice of the remembrance of the Divine will save us from dire fears and colossal suffering.”

In the light of God,
