      <description>Paramhansa Yogananda came to the West with a God-ordained mission: to bring teachings and techniques to help people attain higher consciousness. With wisdom and foresight, Master and the others in our line of gurus saw that a time of global upheaval was coming to the world. Out of compassion, Yoganandaji brought twofold gifts to help us deal with the impending suffering: 1) spiritual tools to achieve God contact, and 2) divine blessings to help us find the courage, faith, and strength to face what lies ahead.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Paramhansa Yogananda came to the West with a God-ordained mission: to bring teachings and techniques to help people attain higher consciousness. With wisdom and foresight, Master and the others in our line of gurus saw that a time of global upheaval was coming to the world. Out of compassion, Yoganandaji brought twofold gifts to help us deal with the impending suffering: 1) spiritual tools to achieve God contact, and 2) divine blessings to help us find the courage, faith, and strength to face what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends, global upheaval is no longer only a vision of the future; it is already upon us. Hatred, violence, destruction, and warfare are rife. What can we do to help bring light into the world and reestablish peace and harmony in human hearts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of prayer is one of the greatest instruments for positive change. And so I want to share what Yoganandaji taught about making our prayers more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/how-to-pray.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;how-to-pray&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;pray-from-your-heart&#34;&gt;Pray from Your Heart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to speak the inner language of prayer with calm, sincere words that spring from your heart. This is not an emotionally wrought state of mind, but one that has the quiet, open trust of a child lovingly asking his mother for help. This kind of intimate conversation with God unfailingly draws His response. Yogananda said, “When you pray to God, pray from your heart. Heartfelt prayer lends power to your thoughts. It focuses them, and centers them in God. Without sincerity, that focus will be lacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pray-with-confidence&#34;&gt;Pray with Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you pray, cast aside doubts and limiting thoughts. Offer your prayers, not with a sense of entitlement, but with quiet confidence and faith that God wants to help you. Yoganandaji told us, “Never pray with the attitude of a beggar. You are God’s child. Pray with utter confidence that He is listening. Utter faith, and love: these are the most important elements in prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pray-with-concentration&#34;&gt;Pray with Concentration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before praying, calm the heart and quiet the mind through meditation. Then, when your thoughts are still, concentrate at the spiritual eye and project your prayers with a laser-like focus. Don’t become tense, but with relaxed, one-pointed energy keep holding your prayer up to God. Do it repeatedly, until you begin to feel His presence. Master said, “God answers all prayers, but restless prayers He answers only a little bit. Get control over your mind. When you can pray with concentration, the Lord will know that you mean what you are saying. Then, He will answer you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-peace-and-harmony-prayer&#34;&gt;The Peace and Harmony Prayer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master gave one of his direct disciples the inspiration for a powerful tool for healing conflict: what we’ve come to call “The Peace and Harmony Prayer.” It can be used to heal discord between individuals and between nations. In this context, we encourage you to use it for global healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prayer is quite simple. Visualize the world bathed in light, and for one minute repeat the words: “Lord, fill this world with peace and harmony, peace and harmony.” Then visualize yourself in light, and pray for fifteen seconds: “Lord, fill me with peace and harmony, peace and harmony.” You can use this prayer, or any other that resonates with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my friend, we invite you to join in prayer with your brothers and sisters in God throughout the world. With devotion, confidence, and concentration, let’s offer our united prayers for world peace. As Christ says in the Bible, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. . . . And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With joy and hope,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of One</title>

      <description>At Prince Siddhartha’s birth, his father, the king of the realm, was told that his son would be either a powerful ruler or a great spiritual leader. Wanting his royal lineage to continue, the king did everything he could to prevent the young prince from seeing the ephemeral nature of life. This, he hoped, would keep him from seeking higher realities.
The king therefore instructed the royal charioteers never to take the prince into the city, where he would see the common lot of human suffering.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;At Prince Siddhartha’s birth, his father, the king of the realm, was told that his son would be either a powerful ruler or a great spiritual leader. Wanting his royal lineage to continue, the king did everything he could to prevent the young prince from seeing the ephemeral nature of life. This, he hoped, would keep him from seeking higher realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king therefore instructed the royal charioteers never to take the prince into the city, where he would see the common lot of human suffering. To keep him further absorbed in the transitory world, the king built a beautiful pleasure palace for Siddhartha filled with lovely young maidens and youths whose company he could continually enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the day eventually arrived when Prince Siddhartha grew restless and tired of his idyllic life. He called his charioteer and told him to drive him into the nearby city. Knowing that the king had forbidden this, the chariot driver tried to dissuade his prince from going, but Siddhartha insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the city the golden chariot went. Here, for the first time, Siddhartha saw someone desperately ill. Shocked, the young prince demanded, “What is that?” His charioteer replied, “That is sickness, my lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it happen to everyone?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord,” the driver replied. Siddhartha struggled to absorb this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On they went through the city until they spotted someone old and decrepit. “What is that?” the prince asked in a trembling voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is old age, my lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it happen to everyone?” Siddhartha again asked in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord.” Now the prince was in a state of deep turmoil as he saw the suffering inherent in human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally they saw a funeral procession with a dead body being carried to the cremation grounds. Deeply shocked, he asked one last time, “What is that, driver?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That, my lord, is death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it come to everyone?” he asked with great earnestness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord. It comes to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/the-power-of-one.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;the power of one&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So deep had been Siddhartha’s absorption in the transitory nature of the world, it seemed as though time had now stopped. The next day he left behind his kingdom, his pleasure palace, and all the comforts he had known. He was determined to find enlightenment in order to alleviate the suffering of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of seeking and striving, he finally achieved his goal and became the Buddha, “the Enlightened One.” On the day of his spiritual awakening, in the forests of Bodh Gaya, the unseen power of one soul uniting with God reverberated throughout the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storytellers recount that in distant parts of the country a fishmonger and his wife ceased arguing; a dishonest merchant decided to treat his customers fairly; a widow lost in grief was suddenly comforted; and a ruler abandoned his plans to wage war on a neighboring kingdom. A great pulse of peace, compassion, and harmony spread across rivers, mountains, and valleys, and changed everyone it touched. That is the power of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world in which we live today is rife with tension, dishonesty, power-seeking, violence, and warfare. In the face of it all, feeling helpless and hopeless as so many do, it is far too easy to fall into a pit of despair. Yet each of us has within him the power to make a difference. Here are three ways that we can release the power of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expand-your-inner-peace-through-meditation&#34;&gt;Expand Your Inner Peace Through Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time during each meditation consciously resting in inner peace. When you feel this aspect of God, concentrate on its vibration, and let peace permeate your being. Then expand it outward to touch other people and lands. Each day, try to expand the time you are absorbed in peace, and return to this awareness throughout the day. Make it your reality. Feel that you live and move in a bubble of peace, and share it with all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-heroically&#34;&gt;Love Heroically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, when Swami Kriyananda was asked for the best way to prepare for hard times in the world, he replied, “Learn to love heroically.” Be more aware of the needs of others, and do what you can to help them. Pray for those people and nations that are suffering. Pray especially for anyone for whom you’ve had negative feelings. Transform your heart into a fountain of unconditional love for all—whether they be good or evil, wise or foolish, friend or foe. Without any regard for such distinctions God loves all equally. We should strive to do likewise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever lies ahead, we should keep our hearts filled with love for God, and faith in Him. Trust in the thought that His loving protection is with us always. Perhaps this finds its best expression in the immortal words of the Twenty-Third Psalm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths ofrighteousness for his name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Buddha attained enlightenment, he gave us a model of how we, too, can help others through our spiritual efforts. The power of one soul can make a difference in this world of suffering. Let us unite our efforts and expand this power of one to embrace countless numbers of people everywhere. Then, the world will know true peace and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend in God,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All the World is My Friend</title>

      <description>We have two dear friends in Australia who are helping to lead Ananda’s growing work there. The man is a person with great openness of heart. When we spoke with them recently, his wife shared that when they’re in public, often a stranger will come up to him and ask, “Do I know you? It seems like we’ve met before.” In most cases they’ve never met, but there’s a quality about our friend that makes him feel familiar, even to strangers.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;We have two dear friends in Australia who are helping to lead Ananda’s growing work there. The man is a person with great openness of heart. When we spoke with them recently, his wife shared that when they’re in public, often a stranger will come up to him and ask, “Do I know you? It seems like we’ve met before.” In most cases they’ve never met, but there’s a quality about our friend that makes him feel familiar, even to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the same phenomenon when traveling with Swami Kriyananda. People would often approach him, not having a clue about who he was, and ask if they might sit with him and talk. If it was possible, Swamiji would listen to them as they shared their problems, and offer what advice he could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that people can feel so close and trusting with a stranger? There are several factors at play. First, as I mentioned about our Australian friend, his expansive heart quality touches people on some level. Through the practice of meditation and devotion, we naturally begin to project our love to everyone and everything around us. Others sense this love, and although it isn’t directed towards them personally, they are drawn to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remarkable statement is attributed to Buddha: “We should try to love everyone we meet, because during the long journey of countless past incarnations, we have, indeed, known and loved each one.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/all-the-world-is-my-friend.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;all the world is my friend&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Strangers are also drawn to us when we radiate peace, a quality which develops naturally as we learn to be more centered in ourselves. Once in India with Swami Kriyananda, we were traveling together on a crowded plane. Every seat was taken, so Swamiji sat a few rows behind us. Upon landing, as we prepared to disembark through the front of the plane, we were instructed to allow those in the back rows to exit first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Swamiji passed by us in the aisle, he smiled and nodded. Though he was dressed in Western clothes, rather than his customary ochre robes, an aura of tranquility radiated from him. Two Indian gentlemen standing behind us had watched him greet us and asked who he was. After we explained, one of them commented, “India needs more men like that today.” Swamiji hadn’t spoken a single word, but they could feel the peace and joy of his consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the regular practice of meditation, we begin to change in ways of which we perhaps aren’t even aware. A greater capacity to love, unshakable peace, and deep joy under all circumstances—these qualities and many others become a part of who we are. Others may not know us or be aware of what is causing it, but they feel better in our presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American philosopher and writer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said, “Who you are speaks so loudly, I can’t hear what you are saying.” The greatest good we can do in the world is to fill ourselves with those qualities—love, peace, harmony, acceptance—which humanity needs so deeply now. Though we need never speak a word, our God-attuned consciousness has a great power to uplift those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a wonderful practice also to actively share love with everyone, whether you know them are not. Look for the discouraged face, or the lonely heart, and help them to feel that someone cares. The more we serve as channels for God’s love, the more we feel that love flowing through us. As Master said, “The channel is blessed by that which flows through it.” Let divine love flow through you unimpeded, and you will begin to awaken to your oneness with all life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swami Kriyananda wrote a song for children that carries this message beautifully. The words are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;All the world is my friend
   When I learn how to share my love—
When I stretch out my hand and smile,
   When I live from above.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In divine friendship,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;
