      <description>When a famous Hollywood actor, Herb Jeffries, met Paramhansa Yogananda for the first time, he asked a question that resonates with many, though few have the courage to voice it:
“Religion seems to tell me you shan’t do this, and you must not do that. I’m not interested in what I can’t do. What I want to know is what I can do.”
Master’s reply was simple, profound, and fun. “Do you smoke?</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When a famous Hollywood actor, Herb Jeffries, met Paramhansa Yogananda for the first time, he asked a question that resonates with many, though few have the courage to voice it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Religion seems to tell me you shan’t do this, and you must not do that. I’m not interested in what I can’t do. What I want to know is what I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master’s reply was simple, profound, and fun. “Do you smoke?” he asked. “Yes,” came the reply. Master’s response surprised him: “You may continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was, “Do you drink alcohol?” “Yes,” was the reply. Again Master said, “You may continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, “Do you enjoy the company of women?” “YES!” “You may continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master ended by saying, “You may continue with all of these activities. But I must warn you, that if you take up this path, the desire to do them will fall away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoganandaji taught that it is what we do that makes us holy, not what we don’t do. His guru, Sri Yukteswar, said, “The vanished lives of all men are dark with many shames. . . . Everything in future will improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only three things are absolutely essential: First is the desire to improve; second, the self-discipline to practice consistently; and finally, being open to help from a guide. Other qualities are important, but if these three are in place, the rest will follow naturally in its own time, just as the flowers of spring develop naturally into the fruits of fall.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/what-is-essential.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;what is essential&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are currently staying in an apartment in Delhi that we share with our dear friend Nayaswami Dhyana. She has recently taken up playing the esraj, a bowed Indian instrument. A person of great enthusiasm and energy, she personifies these three qualities. She has a strong desire to learn to play the esraj, partly for the sheer joy of playing music, but also so she can play the chants and songs of Paramhansa Yogananda and Swami Kriyananda as an aid to her attunement. Next, she practices two hours a day without fail. And, finally, she takes regular lessons from a teacher, Kashif, a master musician who himself started playing Indian classical music at age five and has practiced for hours each day for over forty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, unbeknownst to Dhyana till now, we learned that Kashif’s father was a world-renowned musician who played for Yogananda when he was just fourteen years old. How strange are the graces of the guru and the threads of karma that weave together the tapestry of our life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has either the time or inclination to make such a dedicated effort. Consistency is more important than quantity, especially when we are just beginning a new endeavor. Swami Kriyananda would sometimes tell people, “Just try to meditate five minutes each day. You spend that much time on your dental hygiene. You can certainly do the same for your mental and spiritual hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a teacher or guru is vital, he or she cannot and will not do the work for us. Our spiritual search will evolve so long as we make the effort. Day by day, year by year, a steady desire to improve plus consistent practice will produce magical results. Ultimately, all is accomplished by God’s grace, but it is our soul’s yearning accompanied by self-effort that draws that grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yogananda wrote, “Suppose you want riches. Will you sit in a room and wait for God to give them to you simply because you believe in Him? Hardly! You’ll work very hard to earn them. Why, then, expect salvation to come to you effortlessly, just because you believe?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we embark on the spiritual adventure to discover the endless potential within us, there is no magic wand that can substitute for our own effort. As Swami Kriyananda said, “Sometimes we just have to roll up our sleeves and get to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In divine friendship,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Jyotish&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why We Meditate</title>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong meditator, I love to hear people’s experiences of how meditation has helped them. Here are a few such stories which, taken together, show a broad spectrum of benefits that meditation can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was talking with a friend, the mother of three children under the age of six, who has begun meditating during the past year. She told me, “Meditation is helping me be a better parent. I’m much calmer when dealing with my three rambunctious kids. I find I’m not reacting as much as I used to, but stay relaxed no matter what’s going on. And I’m able to be stronger in myself and not waver when disciplining them or setting boundaries. All this is really having a positive effect on my kids, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year a young doctor from Delhi told us about the tremendous challenges he and his hospital staff faced during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in India: “At a certain point, we had run out of all supplies—medicine, oxygen, and hospital beds—and were even putting critically ill patients on the floor in the hallways. All we could essentially do was to comfort people as they died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One day, after working long hours and witnessing many deaths, I was returning home filled with exhaustion and despair. ‘I can’t go on like this,’ I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then I saw a poster announcing a meditation class at an Ananda center near my apartment. I don’t know why, but I signed up and began learning the techniques. Almost immediately, I started to feel inwardly strengthened and renewed. I know it was meditation that gave me the ability to keep going during those difficult times. I’ve continued with my practice and recently received Kriya initiation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once one of Ananda’s senior teachers in India was giving an introductory talk for a course on meditation. After he had finished speaking, the attendees asked a lot of perceptive, interested questions. Then one man stood up, and rather defiantly asked, “You’ve been meditating for many years. Do you have any spiritual powers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher paused, then replied quietly, “No, I can’t say that I have any powers.” A general sigh of disappointment could be heard throughout the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he continued, “Oh, but, I do have one: I have the power to be happy at will.” Another sigh moved through the audience, this time one of appreciation. The teacher concluded with a twinkle in his eye: “I don’t always use this power, but it’s there if I so choose.” Almost all of those present signed up for the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Autobiography of a Yogi, after his experience in cosmic consciousness, Yoganandaji asked his guru, Sri Yukteswar, “When shall I find God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Yukteswar replied, “You have found Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, sir, I don’t think so!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Yukteswar went on to say, “I see that you are imagining that the possession of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole universe, and find the Lord elusive still! Spiritual advancement is not measured by one’s outward powers, but only by the depth of his bliss in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ever-new Joy is God. He is inexhaustible; as you continue your meditations during the years, He will beguile you with an infinite ingenuity.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/why-we-meditate.png&#34;  alt=&#34;why we meditate&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The benefits of meditation are there to be had by everyone: to deal better with life’s demands and to help others around us; to find inner strength and balance when faced with seemingly overwhelming tests; to discover one’s own ability to be happy under all circumstances; and to find the ever-new joy of God. It’s our job to keep meditating even when our energy flags, or when we begin to wonder if we’re making any spiritual progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoganandaji, Swami Kriyananda wrote, would often tell his disciples: “If you plant a seed, then keep digging it up to see how it is doing, it will never be able to grow. You must leave it in the ground, and water it daily; then it will surely grow in its own time. So also with the path to God: Plant the seed of divine aspiration; don’t dig it up constantly to see how it is doing, but water it daily with meditation and with divine actions. See also that you surround it with a protective hedge of good company. In time, your little seed will grow into a mighty tree of Self-realization, affording shade and shelter to every passing wayfarer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In joyful friendship,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awaiting the Unexpected</title>

      <description>The spiritual path can sometimes seem like an endless struggle up a steep cliff, with little to show for our efforts along the way. But the ability to find the strength to keep going is what separates the dilettante devotee from the true seeker. Deep commitment is the secret to drawing God’s presence into our life.
There’s a beautiful story that Paramhansa Yogananda tells of a man who was told by his doctors that he was dying of diabetes and had only three months left.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The spiritual path can sometimes seem like an endless struggle up a steep cliff, with little to show for our efforts along the way. But the ability to find the strength to keep going is what separates the dilettante devotee from the true seeker. Deep commitment is the secret to drawing God’s presence into our life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a beautiful story that Paramhansa Yogananda tells of a man who was told by his doctors that he was dying of diabetes and had only three months left. He thought, “If I have only three months remaining in this lifetime, let me spend them seeking God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, he couldn’t meditate for more than fifteen minutes at a time, but gradually, as he persevered, he was able to sit for longer periods each day. His prayer during his meditations was not to be healed, but rather, “Lord, come into this broken temple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months passed, then a year, and he was still alive. Continuing in intense prayer, he was by now meditating eighteen hours a day. Two more years passed. Suddenly a great light filled his being. The man was absorbed in divine ecstasy, and found to his amazement that his body was completely healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lord,” he prayed, “I didn’t ask for a healing—only that You come to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God answered his beloved devotee, “Where My light is, there no darkness can dwell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saint—for he’d become one—wrote in the sand with his finger, “And on this day the Lord came into my broken temple, and made it whole!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we find such commitment to keep going until we’ve reached our spiritual goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, don’t allow yourself the luxury of deciding each day whether or not you’re going to meditate. Instead make a firm inner commitment to be regular in your practice, and don’t question it. Build your schedule around your times of meditation, and let other duties fall into place around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those times when you’re not able to meditate as long, set a minimum amount of time below which you won’t go. Try to establish a regular routine in the morning and evening. Twice daily meditation is very important, because it keeps your consciousness in an upward flow, starting and ending each day with the thought of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to look at the lives of others who have struggled in their spiritual efforts, yet were victorious in the end. For you are not alone in this battle: Such challenges are faced by every saint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first year at Ananda, I went through a period of discouragement, and questioned if I should continue on the spiritual path. At that time there was a wonderful old gentleman living here who had been a disciple of Master for decades. He was both our gardening mentor and a great friend to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, filled with discouragement and doubts, I gloomily asked him, “Why does God make it so hard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answer has had a deep impact on me: “There must be some value in the effort itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/awaiting-the-unexpected.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;awaiting the unexpected&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I came to understand that it’s perseverance in the search for God that draws us closer to Him. When discouragement returns (and it does from time to time) I remember that simply trying has its own spiritual reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that Master said that in each meditation, we should be ready to make a “dash for the Infinite.” Only God knows when He will come to us. And so we must be ready for Him at any moment, even in the midst of lackluster meditations and restless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Yoganandaji’s most thrilling statements is: “I remember the day when for the first time, unlooked-for, from behind the clouds of the drudgery of routine meditative habits, the aurora of bliss suddenly burst upon my consciousness. It surpassed all my expectations. Joy indescribable!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who can say how many lifetimes ago this great avatar experienced the “drudgery of routine meditative habits”? Who can imagine what the “aurora of bliss” is really like? Yet, his words, filled with promise and hope, are beacons of light to guide us forward when finding God seems beyond our reach. Let’s await that unexpected moment. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we reach the journey’s end,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;
