      <description>I read a very interesting comment recently from a man who had struggled for many years with obesity. He said that the tipping point finally came when he “realized that I could choose.” With that understanding—that he had the ability to choose what he ate—he was able to lose one hundred seventy-one pounds.
This actually was a profound insight on his part, because he realized he had the power to break the compulsion of bad habits that had kept him in suffering.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I read a very interesting comment recently from a man who had struggled for many years with obesity. He said that the tipping point finally came when he “realized that I could choose.” With that understanding—that he had the ability to choose what he ate—he was able to lose one hundred seventy-one pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually was a profound insight on his part, because he realized he had the power to break the compulsion of bad habits that had kept him in suffering. He discovered within himself the freedom to choose the right action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight has great importance for all of us seeking soul freedom. We mistakenly think that the chains of karma keep us forever bound in delusion, when, in truth, we have the power at any time to make the kind of choices that will set us free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an especially useful concept now, as we end 2023 and begin to look at the changes we want to make in 2024. How many New Year’s resolutions fall by the wayside because we approach them using only our will power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, will power is important in making any positive change, but if we are resisting the change mentally, we only create inner conflict and tension that block our will. When we realize that we can choose our actions, and then apply will power, all the pieces fall into place. This opens the door to success in achieving our goals, be they material or spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important choice we can make is to discriminate about what we allow to enter our consciousness. A friend recently told me a wonderful story that appears to date from the mid-1800s. More recently, for dramatic effect, it has been attributed in the modern internet fashion to Socrates, and goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a man came running up to Socrates, and said, “I have to tell you something about your friend who . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop,” Socrates interrupted him. “Before you tell me, have you put it through the three sieves?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to share his news, the man nevertheless asked, “What are those?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first sieve is that of truth,” Socrates explained. “Are you certain that what you are going to tell me is true?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, no,” the man answered. “I just overheard it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates continued, “What about the sieve of goodness? Is what you tell me something good or positive about this man?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fellow could only shake his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Socrates asked, “And the last sieve is this: Will it be useful for me to know this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the man bowed his head in shame. Smiling, Socrates said, “If your story is neither true, nor good, nor useful, please don’t bother me with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are excellent guidelines for what we allow ourselves to hear and say, for we can choose what enters our mind and leaves our mouth. We’re all bombarded with news and opinions from others, not to mention those from social media. Rather than go down a rabbit hole of false information, choose what you know to be true, positive, and useful for you to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/choices.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;choices&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Equally important, pass what you say about someone else through those criteria. Mentally create a strong barrier in your mind, through which no critical or unkind words can pass. You’ll be surprised at the positive effect this has on your consciousness, and the freedom it brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most important choice we can make is to focus our life more completely on our spiritual goals. Recently we watched the recording of an inspiring talk that Swami Kriyananda gave called “The Christmas Mystery.” He concludes with these words: “Resolve in the coming year to live more in God.” This is a choice we consciously can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in this prayer from A Festival of Light, the beautiful ceremony created by Swamiji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;O Lord,
With all my heart,
With all my mind,
With all my soul,
And with all my strength
I choose Thy love—
I choose only Thee.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once this choice is wholeheartedly made, we begin to walk the sure path that leads to union with God. Then all other choices pale in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you a blessed New Year,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Saint and the Scorpion</title>

      <description>There is a story about a saint who was peacefully meditating under a tree along the banks of the Ganges. At a certain point he heard a rustling overhead and opened his eyes to see a large scorpion moving along a branch overhanging the river.
When the creature reached the end of the branch, it fell into the water below. Filled with compassion, the saint waded into the river to rescue it.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There is a story about a saint who was peacefully meditating under a tree along the banks of the Ganges. At a certain point he heard a rustling overhead and opened his eyes to see a large scorpion moving along a branch overhanging the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the creature reached the end of the branch, it fell into the water below. Filled with compassion, the saint waded into the river to rescue it. Cupping his hands together, he lifted the drowning scorpion and placed him gently on the river’s bank. In return for his kindness, the scorpion stung him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unperturbed, the saint then returned to the peace of his meditation. Again he heard a rustling overhead, again the scorpion plunged into the water, and again the saint rescued him, only to be stung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happened a third time, a passerby who had been observing the drama could no longer contain himself. Approaching the saint, he asked, “Sir, why do you continue to rescue the scorpion, when each time he stings you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well,” the saint replied, his eyes luminous with divine love, “you see, it is the nature of the scorpion to sting. He cannot help himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That may be so, reverend sir, but knowing this, why do you continue to rescue him?” the passerby asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You see, my child, I too cannot help myself. It is my nature to help him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story provides us with a valuable lesson in how to live. Each of us encounters “human scorpions” filled with venom and spite whose sting can cause us suffering. But whether insect or human being, such creatures are driven by instinct or the compulsions of past karma, and have no choice but to sting whenever they feel threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saint, by choosing to attune his consciousness to God’s love, had the freedom to express that love under all circumstances. Like the saint, we, too, can choose to align our actions with divine love and peace, no matter what is happening around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first this choice requires an act of will, as the ego tries to protect itself. With repeated effort and determination, however, the choice becomes “second nature.” Unlike the scorpion driven by instinct, we find that the higher path, illumined by a constant flow of divine grace, opens clearly before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, all decisions in life then become very simple. As a great saint once said, “We have but one decision to make in life: whether to think of God or not.” All the rest are details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/the-saint-and-the-scorpion.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;the saint and the scorpion&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uniting our efforts, we can create a great realm of light that can guide the world forward into a new era of peace and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we are enjoying the inspiration of our annual Spiritual Renewal Week at Ananda Village. Friends from all over the world have joined us in a wonderful celebration of Master’s blessings and teachings. The theme for the week is “Uplift Yourself—Uplift the World,” exploring how raising our own consciousness improves not only ourselves but the world around us as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the saint, we can choose to express divine love and forgiveness no matter how the world behaves. Then we build an inner fortress of higher consciousness which is impenetrable to the forces of darkness. Uniting our efforts, we can create a great realm of light that can guide the world forward into a new era of peace and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With joy and blessings in God and Guru,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;
