      <description>At Prince Siddhartha’s birth, his father, the king of the realm, was told that his son would be either a powerful ruler or a great spiritual leader. Wanting his royal lineage to continue, the king did everything he could to prevent the young prince from seeing the ephemeral nature of life. This, he hoped, would keep him from seeking higher realities.
The king therefore instructed the royal charioteers never to take the prince into the city, where he would see the common lot of human suffering.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;At Prince Siddhartha’s birth, his father, the king of the realm, was told that his son would be either a powerful ruler or a great spiritual leader. Wanting his royal lineage to continue, the king did everything he could to prevent the young prince from seeing the ephemeral nature of life. This, he hoped, would keep him from seeking higher realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king therefore instructed the royal charioteers never to take the prince into the city, where he would see the common lot of human suffering. To keep him further absorbed in the transitory world, the king built a beautiful pleasure palace for Siddhartha filled with lovely young maidens and youths whose company he could continually enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the day eventually arrived when Prince Siddhartha grew restless and tired of his idyllic life. He called his charioteer and told him to drive him into the nearby city. Knowing that the king had forbidden this, the chariot driver tried to dissuade his prince from going, but Siddhartha insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the city the golden chariot went. Here, for the first time, Siddhartha saw someone desperately ill. Shocked, the young prince demanded, “What is that?” His charioteer replied, “That is sickness, my lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it happen to everyone?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord,” the driver replied. Siddhartha struggled to absorb this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On they went through the city until they spotted someone old and decrepit. “What is that?” the prince asked in a trembling voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is old age, my lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it happen to everyone?” Siddhartha again asked in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord.” Now the prince was in a state of deep turmoil as he saw the suffering inherent in human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally they saw a funeral procession with a dead body being carried to the cremation grounds. Deeply shocked, he asked one last time, “What is that, driver?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That, my lord, is death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does it come to everyone?” he asked with great earnestness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, my lord. It comes to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/the-power-of-one.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;the power of one&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So deep had been Siddhartha’s absorption in the transitory nature of the world, it seemed as though time had now stopped. The next day he left behind his kingdom, his pleasure palace, and all the comforts he had known. He was determined to find enlightenment in order to alleviate the suffering of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of seeking and striving, he finally achieved his goal and became the Buddha, “the Enlightened One.” On the day of his spiritual awakening, in the forests of Bodh Gaya, the unseen power of one soul uniting with God reverberated throughout the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storytellers recount that in distant parts of the country a fishmonger and his wife ceased arguing; a dishonest merchant decided to treat his customers fairly; a widow lost in grief was suddenly comforted; and a ruler abandoned his plans to wage war on a neighboring kingdom. A great pulse of peace, compassion, and harmony spread across rivers, mountains, and valleys, and changed everyone it touched. That is the power of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world in which we live today is rife with tension, dishonesty, power-seeking, violence, and warfare. In the face of it all, feeling helpless and hopeless as so many do, it is far too easy to fall into a pit of despair. Yet each of us has within him the power to make a difference. Here are three ways that we can release the power of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expand-your-inner-peace-through-meditation&#34;&gt;Expand Your Inner Peace Through Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time during each meditation consciously resting in inner peace. When you feel this aspect of God, concentrate on its vibration, and let peace permeate your being. Then expand it outward to touch other people and lands. Each day, try to expand the time you are absorbed in peace, and return to this awareness throughout the day. Make it your reality. Feel that you live and move in a bubble of peace, and share it with all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-heroically&#34;&gt;Love Heroically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, when Swami Kriyananda was asked for the best way to prepare for hard times in the world, he replied, “Learn to love heroically.” Be more aware of the needs of others, and do what you can to help them. Pray for those people and nations that are suffering. Pray especially for anyone for whom you’ve had negative feelings. Transform your heart into a fountain of unconditional love for all—whether they be good or evil, wise or foolish, friend or foe. Without any regard for such distinctions God loves all equally. We should strive to do likewise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever lies ahead, we should keep our hearts filled with love for God, and faith in Him. Trust in the thought that His loving protection is with us always. Perhaps this finds its best expression in the immortal words of the Twenty-Third Psalm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths ofrighteousness for his name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Buddha attained enlightenment, he gave us a model of how we, too, can help others through our spiritual efforts. The power of one soul can make a difference in this world of suffering. Let us unite our efforts and expand this power of one to embrace countless numbers of people everywhere. Then, the world will know true peace and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend in God,&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We are in Assisi, immersed in a Spiritual Renewal Week with the theme “How to Develop Spiritual Power Against Troubled Times.” There is a common misperception in which people confuse developing spiritual power with spiritual powers, the ability to perform miracles.
In today’s class one of the speakers talked about the time when Paramhansa Yogananda visited Therese Neumann, the Bavarian saint. In a chapter about this visit in Autobiography of a Yogi, Yogananda revealed that, in her elevated consciousness, Therese had transcended the need for food.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;We are in Assisi, immersed in a Spiritual Renewal Week with the theme “How to Develop Spiritual Power Against Troubled Times.” There is a common misperception in which people confuse developing spiritual power with spiritual powers, the ability to perform miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s class one of the speakers talked about the time when Paramhansa Yogananda visited Therese Neumann, the Bavarian saint. In a chapter about this visit in Autobiography of a Yogi, Yogananda revealed that, in her elevated consciousness, Therese had transcended the need for food. She said that she awoke one day with neither the need nor the desire to eat. In other words, this “power” came to her spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guests attending the program posed the question, “Why didn’t she teach others how to do this? It seems selfish that she kept this ability to herself.” I admit that I was a little shocked by the audacity of the question. I suspect that while many might wonder quietly why the saints don’t share their secrets more openly, few would voice such a question in a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uma, one of the teachers, gave a marvelous answer. She said that the saints and masters tell us quite openly how to develop such abilities. We just don’t like their answers or their methods. We want to be given a quick fix, but they tell us that it doesn’t work that way. Powers come naturally as our consciousness becomes expanded and elevated. In Therese’s profound connection and attunement to Jesus, she had effectively merged with him. His sufferings became hers to the extent that in her weekly trances she exhibited his wounds on her own body. So the answer to the question of how to rise above the need to eat is to become so immersed in love and devotion that hunger, along with everything else, becomes irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/spiritual-power.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;spiritual-power&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How does one develop such powers? We don’t so much acquire them as embody them. In a sense, Jesus gave us clear instructions for how to walk on water, or heal others, or feed the masses: “Love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.” As long as we, the ego, want powers, they will elude us. But as the ego dissolves, God, the only power in the universe, will use us as He wills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago we heard a miraculous story from Malka, an Indian friend of ours. After visiting Ananda Village on a pilgrimage, she headed to New York to spend time with her sister. One evening, she fell down some stairs and crushed her arm. At the hospital she was told that she would need emergency surgery. The injuries were so extensive, however, that the surgeon didn’t know if he could knit the shattered bones together, or if he would have to amputate her arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably distraught, she sleeplessly awaited her impending surgery. Amidst her pain and fear, Swami Kriyananda walked into her room. Gently stroking her arm, he assured her, “Don’t worry, Malka. Everything will be fine.” At his soothing words, she fell into a peaceful sleep. The morning surgery was a success, and when we saw her a year later, she joyfully waved her arm in the air to demonstrate the complete healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarkable feature of the story is that Swami Kriyananda was in California the entire time. When we told him about it, he said, “I have no conscious knowledge of doing that.” But then he added a very deep teaching about the essence of spiritual power: “The soul can act independently of the ego. Nor does it need the ego’s permission to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another way of saying that when we transcend the limitations of ego, God can work wonders through us. Our part is to cooperate with His grace by developing limitless love and the deep desire to help others. Once we fully allow God to flow through us, we will have both spiritual power and, if needed, spiritual powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In His love and joy,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why We Meditate</title>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong meditator, I love to hear people’s experiences of how meditation has helped them. Here are a few such stories which, taken together, show a broad spectrum of benefits that meditation can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was talking with a friend, the mother of three children under the age of six, who has begun meditating during the past year. She told me, “Meditation is helping me be a better parent. I’m much calmer when dealing with my three rambunctious kids. I find I’m not reacting as much as I used to, but stay relaxed no matter what’s going on. And I’m able to be stronger in myself and not waver when disciplining them or setting boundaries. All this is really having a positive effect on my kids, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year a young doctor from Delhi told us about the tremendous challenges he and his hospital staff faced during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in India: “At a certain point, we had run out of all supplies—medicine, oxygen, and hospital beds—and were even putting critically ill patients on the floor in the hallways. All we could essentially do was to comfort people as they died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One day, after working long hours and witnessing many deaths, I was returning home filled with exhaustion and despair. ‘I can’t go on like this,’ I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then I saw a poster announcing a meditation class at an Ananda center near my apartment. I don’t know why, but I signed up and began learning the techniques. Almost immediately, I started to feel inwardly strengthened and renewed. I know it was meditation that gave me the ability to keep going during those difficult times. I’ve continued with my practice and recently received Kriya initiation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once one of Ananda’s senior teachers in India was giving an introductory talk for a course on meditation. After he had finished speaking, the attendees asked a lot of perceptive, interested questions. Then one man stood up, and rather defiantly asked, “You’ve been meditating for many years. Do you have any spiritual powers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher paused, then replied quietly, “No, I can’t say that I have any powers.” A general sigh of disappointment could be heard throughout the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he continued, “Oh, but, I do have one: I have the power to be happy at will.” Another sigh moved through the audience, this time one of appreciation. The teacher concluded with a twinkle in his eye: “I don’t always use this power, but it’s there if I so choose.” Almost all of those present signed up for the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Autobiography of a Yogi, after his experience in cosmic consciousness, Yoganandaji asked his guru, Sri Yukteswar, “When shall I find God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Yukteswar replied, “You have found Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no, sir, I don’t think so!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Yukteswar went on to say, “I see that you are imagining that the possession of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole universe, and find the Lord elusive still! Spiritual advancement is not measured by one’s outward powers, but only by the depth of his bliss in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ever-new Joy is God. He is inexhaustible; as you continue your meditations during the years, He will beguile you with an infinite ingenuity.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/why-we-meditate.png&#34;  alt=&#34;why we meditate&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The benefits of meditation are there to be had by everyone: to deal better with life’s demands and to help others around us; to find inner strength and balance when faced with seemingly overwhelming tests; to discover one’s own ability to be happy under all circumstances; and to find the ever-new joy of God. It’s our job to keep meditating even when our energy flags, or when we begin to wonder if we’re making any spiritual progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoganandaji, Swami Kriyananda wrote, would often tell his disciples: “If you plant a seed, then keep digging it up to see how it is doing, it will never be able to grow. You must leave it in the ground, and water it daily; then it will surely grow in its own time. So also with the path to God: Plant the seed of divine aspiration; don’t dig it up constantly to see how it is doing, but water it daily with meditation and with divine actions. See also that you surround it with a protective hedge of good company. In time, your little seed will grow into a mighty tree of Self-realization, affording shade and shelter to every passing wayfarer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In joyful friendship,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;
