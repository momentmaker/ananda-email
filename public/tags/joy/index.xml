      <description>There are times when life seems to bear down on us. It’s difficult then to remain positive amidst the challenges in our life, and that we see in the lives of others, and in the world at large. Yet in this world of duality, the alternating waves of joy and sorrow are a constant. It’s how we deal with them that keeps us either forever tossed on the crashing waves of maya, or resting in the unmoving peace of God.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There are times when life seems to bear down on us. It’s difficult then to remain positive amidst the challenges in our life, and that we see in the lives of others, and in the world at large. Yet in this world of duality, the alternating waves of joy and sorrow are a constant. It’s how we deal with them that keeps us either forever tossed on the crashing waves of maya, or resting in the unmoving peace of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a very dear friend at Ananda, Nayaswami Maria Warner, who battled cancer for many years until her passing in 2010. In the face of repeated surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy, she never lost her resilience, nor her desire to serve and seek God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the last months of her life it was discovered that the cancer had spread to her brain. As her husband, who was struggling with the thought of what lay ahead, pushed her in a wheelchair into the hospital, she looked up at him and calmly said: “Detach yourself. Control the reactive process. Live the teachings.” These profound words have become known as “Maria’s Mantra,” and have offered guidance and solace to many in the midst of their own struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we find the wisdom and strength to rise above life’s challenges? Try to see the bigger picture, of which we are only an infinitesimally small part. In other words, put yourself in the context of a larger scheme of things, and live in life’s longer rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Swami Kriyananda needed to have some painful dental work done, and declined anesthetic because he didn’t like the feeling of dullness it caused. He later told us that during the procedure, he thought, “I’ve had a long, rewarding life filled with many happy memories. This present pain is just one moment in the whole scheme of my life’s experiences.” Everything went smoothly, and Swamiji ended up composing music in his mind as the dentist worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also good to take time out and absorb yourself in the vast vistas of nature. Jyotish and I just spent a week by the ocean walking along beautiful coastal trails. We were filled with joy at the power of great, crashing waves, and with wonder at the amazing diversity of life in the tide pools. It was wonderfully refreshing and uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into nature and gaze at scenes that expand your consciousness: mountains, the ocean, or a star-filled sky. Remember, however, that what we behold outside of us is only a reflection of what lies within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swami Kriyananda used to enjoy describing a cartoon that he’d once seen in The New Yorker magazine. It showed a pompous businessman with his wife gazing up at the stars. She had obviously asked him a question, and his reply in the caption was: “Make me feel small? Not at all. I was just made regional manager for my company.” Life’s wonders are lost on the self-absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/be-the-big-picture.png&#34;  alt=&#34;be-the-big-picture&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To see the big picture, we must first expand our consciousness through meditation. Feel joy within, and then behold it in the beauty of flowers. Feel love within, then behold it in the great diversity of life. Feel calm expansion within, then feel the peace of the infinite reach of stars. Feel unmoving stillness within, and see it reflected in the mountains. Feel God’s limitless power, and see it in the crashing waves and ocean deeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, it’s not enough only to see the big picture—we must become it. This is the way of self-transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master expresses this in so much of what he has given us. There’s his chant: “I am the bubble / Make me the sea. / Wave of the sea / Dissolve in the sea.” And his poem “Samadhi” concludes with the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A tiny bubble of laughter, I
Am become the Sea of Mirth Itself.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the whole journey of life in a nutshell: Find the tiny bubble of joy within you and expand it until you become the ocean of unlimited bliss. Then, whatever life brings, you know you are a part of something much greater, of something eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend in God,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Steps to Happiness</title>

      <description>Paramhansa Yogananda said that everyone in the world is motivated by the same twin desires: “to be happy and avoid pain.” Each of us can take some simple, and yet surprisingly effective strides toward that goal. Even a series of little steps can produce great changes if we apply them consistently.
The road to happiness starts by replacing bad habits with good ones. Many people have a tendency to focus primarily on physical habits such as diet and exercise.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Paramhansa Yogananda said that everyone in the world is motivated by the same twin desires: “to be happy and avoid pain.” Each of us can take some simple, and yet surprisingly effective strides toward that goal. Even a series of little steps can produce great changes if we apply them consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to happiness starts by replacing bad habits with good ones. Many people have a tendency to focus primarily on physical habits such as diet and exercise. But since we have a body, mind, and soul, we need to address all three aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swami Kriyananda wrote, “During an interview with newspapermen Master prescribed the following rules as a good daily regimen for all: ‘Morning and evening sit in introspective silence thinking of your most important engagement with the soul within. Exercise fifteen minutes. Walk thirty minutes. Study one hour. Meditate one hour and a half. Smile from within all hours.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/simple-steps-to-happiness.png&#34;  alt=&#34;simple-steps-to-happiness&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A recent study at the University of California at Berkeley revealed some very helpful and hopeful information. Working with more than 70,000 people involved with an initiative called “The Big Joy Project,” scientists found that you can quickly gain a 25% boost in your happiness level by consciously doing “micro-acts of joy.” The study shows that these “micro-acts” led to increased feelings of hope, optimism, and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works this way: Every day for seven consecutive days, do a small act to boost your emotional well-being. For example, make a gratitude list or keep a gratitude journal. Another practice would be to visit a sick friend or do a nice gesture for someone you know, or even better, for a stranger. Yet another micro-act would be to reframe something you think of as negative into a positive perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the benefit of this practice comes from the conscious decision to make a plan for the week, and then to carry out your daily act of “micro-joy.” What better time to start this than the day after Thanksgiving? Take a few moments right now to think about those things for which you are grateful. Write a few notes of gratitude to those who have helped or uplifted you during the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now make a plan for next week of seven daily acts of micro-joy. Doing this will help us reprogram our mental habits. Paramhansa Yogananda said, “Don’t expect to go to heaven unless you carry a portable heaven within your heart every day.” He also gave this counsel: “If you find your thoughts carried away, little by little, as prisoners of temptation, then you should train your armies of self-control. Seek good company, take right care of the body, and keep your thoughts busy with wonder and bliss of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most important, is a daily practice of deep meditation. Sometimes meditators can become discouraged by a lack of experiences. But Master said, “Do not grieve because you do not see light or images in meditation. If you go deep into the perception of bliss you will find there the actual presence of God. Seek the Whole, not a part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do our part and make an effort, God will reach out to help us. One time Master blessed a disciple who was having a hard time financially. The anxiety-ridden student asked Master how he could stay so calm in the face of troubles. The Master looked at him intently and said, “Remember, the same Father who protects me, protects you. He is our common Father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing bad habits with good ones is important, but the greatest thing we can do to improve happiness is to bring God into every aspect of life, and offer everything we have and are into His light. Faith and gratitude are the cures for all our ills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In joyful gratitude,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awaiting the Unexpected</title>

      <description>The spiritual path can sometimes seem like an endless struggle up a steep cliff, with little to show for our efforts along the way. But the ability to find the strength to keep going is what separates the dilettante devotee from the true seeker. Deep commitment is the secret to drawing God’s presence into our life.
There’s a beautiful story that Paramhansa Yogananda tells of a man who was told by his doctors that he was dying of diabetes and had only three months left.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The spiritual path can sometimes seem like an endless struggle up a steep cliff, with little to show for our efforts along the way. But the ability to find the strength to keep going is what separates the dilettante devotee from the true seeker. Deep commitment is the secret to drawing God’s presence into our life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a beautiful story that Paramhansa Yogananda tells of a man who was told by his doctors that he was dying of diabetes and had only three months left. He thought, “If I have only three months remaining in this lifetime, let me spend them seeking God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, he couldn’t meditate for more than fifteen minutes at a time, but gradually, as he persevered, he was able to sit for longer periods each day. His prayer during his meditations was not to be healed, but rather, “Lord, come into this broken temple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months passed, then a year, and he was still alive. Continuing in intense prayer, he was by now meditating eighteen hours a day. Two more years passed. Suddenly a great light filled his being. The man was absorbed in divine ecstasy, and found to his amazement that his body was completely healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lord,” he prayed, “I didn’t ask for a healing—only that You come to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God answered his beloved devotee, “Where My light is, there no darkness can dwell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saint—for he’d become one—wrote in the sand with his finger, “And on this day the Lord came into my broken temple, and made it whole!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we find such commitment to keep going until we’ve reached our spiritual goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, don’t allow yourself the luxury of deciding each day whether or not you’re going to meditate. Instead make a firm inner commitment to be regular in your practice, and don’t question it. Build your schedule around your times of meditation, and let other duties fall into place around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those times when you’re not able to meditate as long, set a minimum amount of time below which you won’t go. Try to establish a regular routine in the morning and evening. Twice daily meditation is very important, because it keeps your consciousness in an upward flow, starting and ending each day with the thought of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to look at the lives of others who have struggled in their spiritual efforts, yet were victorious in the end. For you are not alone in this battle: Such challenges are faced by every saint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first year at Ananda, I went through a period of discouragement, and questioned if I should continue on the spiritual path. At that time there was a wonderful old gentleman living here who had been a disciple of Master for decades. He was both our gardening mentor and a great friend to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, filled with discouragement and doubts, I gloomily asked him, “Why does God make it so hard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answer has had a deep impact on me: “There must be some value in the effort itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/awaiting-the-unexpected.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;awaiting the unexpected&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I came to understand that it’s perseverance in the search for God that draws us closer to Him. When discouragement returns (and it does from time to time) I remember that simply trying has its own spiritual reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that Master said that in each meditation, we should be ready to make a “dash for the Infinite.” Only God knows when He will come to us. And so we must be ready for Him at any moment, even in the midst of lackluster meditations and restless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Yoganandaji’s most thrilling statements is: “I remember the day when for the first time, unlooked-for, from behind the clouds of the drudgery of routine meditative habits, the aurora of bliss suddenly burst upon my consciousness. It surpassed all my expectations. Joy indescribable!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who can say how many lifetimes ago this great avatar experienced the “drudgery of routine meditative habits”? Who can imagine what the “aurora of bliss” is really like? Yet, his words, filled with promise and hope, are beacons of light to guide us forward when finding God seems beyond our reach. Let’s await that unexpected moment. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we reach the journey’s end,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do the Right Thing</title>
      <link>https://ananda.email/posts/do-the-right-thing/</link>

      <description>It was near the end of a long race. The spectators in the stadium rose to their feet as the two leaders entered, the Kenyan slightly ahead of the young man from the Netherlands. Mistakenly thinking that he had finished, the Kenyan stopped a few yards from the finish line. Instead of racing past him, the Dutchman stopped and shouted that there were still a few more steps to go. The Kenyan was still confused, so the Hollander pushed him across the finish line.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;It was near the end of a long race. The spectators in the stadium rose to their feet as the two leaders entered, the Kenyan slightly ahead of the young man from the Netherlands. Mistakenly thinking that he had finished, the Kenyan stopped a few yards from the finish line. Instead of racing past him, the Dutchman stopped and shouted that there were still a few more steps to go. The Kenyan was still confused, so the Hollander pushed him across the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reporter asked him why he had done that instead of running by and winning the race. The young man replied, “But he was ahead of me. Helping him win was the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” the reporter went on, “but by doing so, you lost the gold medal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man replied simply, “How could I have explained my medal to my mother?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of us, Paramhansa Yogananda is our mother/father, God. If we’re about to do something questionable, it would be wise to ask, “How can I explain this to my Guru?” Swami Kriyananda suggested that we mentally review each day’s events before going to sleep, asking, “How did I do on the field of Kurukshetra (action) today? Which battles did I win? Which ones did I lose?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ says in the Bible, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we practice this advice, the spiritual path loses all its complexity. It becomes simple: Love God, and expand your circle of love to include everyone. The saints of all religions have followed this path. If we do the same, we will be well on our way to becoming saints ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins by just doing what is right. We read a beautiful example of this just a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xavier Jones was a ninth grade student in St. Louis, about to graduate from middle school. Unable to find a ride to his graduation, he asked his brother and a friend to accompany him on the six-mile walk there. When the president of a local college heard the story, she offered the young man a full four-year scholarship to attend college when the time was right. Furthermore, a professional football player gave Jones a new high-end electric bicycle for his future commutes. Jones, you see, has sickle cell anemia, and he and his six siblings lost their mother a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is stories like these that restore our faith in the goodness of people. Examples of noble actions can go viral, spreading goodness and joy from person to person. If we are inspired by the examples mentioned above, then it is time to act in a like manner. Let each of us, clinging to dharma, do something today that can inspire others. Let us behave in such a way that it will be a pleasure to explain our actions to God and Guru before we lay our heads down for sleep tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/do-the-right-thing.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;do the right thing&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ll end by quoting the inscription by Yoganandaji in a first edition of Songs of the Soul that we keep in our meditation room. It reads, “There is one breath that enlivens all strange lands and strangers. Under one sky we live watched by One Father. With my blessings, Swami Yogananda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In divine friendship,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whose Dream is This?</title>
      <link>https://ananda.email/posts/whose-dream-is-this/</link>

      <description>A farmer was standing completely still amidst the wind-blown wheat in his field, deep in thought. His wife came rushing up, beside herself with grief, crying that their only son had just been killed by a cobra. When her husband made no reply, she blurted out, “You are heartless!”
“Forgive me, but you don’t understand,” the farmer replied. “Last night I dreamt that I was a king with seven sons, who all were bitten by cobras and died.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A farmer was standing completely still amidst the wind-blown wheat in his field, deep in thought. His wife came rushing up, beside herself with grief, crying that their only son had just been killed by a cobra. When her husband made no reply, she blurted out, “You are heartless!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forgive me, but you don’t understand,” the farmer replied. “Last night I dreamt that I was a king with seven sons, who all were bitten by cobras and died. Now I am wondering whether I should grieve for my seven dead sons in that dream, or for my one son who has died in this dream we are dreaming now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our life’s experiences, with all their joys and sorrows, mesmerize us with a sense of their undeniable reality. Yet, in truth, everything is only a thought in the mind of God. Paramhansa Yogananda (who related the story above) explains it this way: “This world seems real to you only because God dreamed you into existence along with His cosmic dream. You are a part of His dream. If, at night, you dream that you bump your head against a wall, you may get an imaginary pain in your head. The moment you awake, however, you realize that there was no wall there to hurt you. The pain you experienced was in your mind, but not in your head!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/whose-dream-is-this.png&#34;  alt=&#34;whose dream is this&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The same is true of this dream you are dreaming now. Wake up to the one Reality, God, and you will see that this earth life is just a show. It is nothing but shadows and light!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was a high school student, I was fortunate to have a wise teacher, Mrs. Gottlieb, for an English literature class. During the second semester, after she had gotten to know us better, she did a remarkable thing. Each of the thirty students in the class received a unique reading list of books for our individual growth and enjoyment. How we delighted in comparing one another’s lists and trying to figure out the particular message for us in every book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small way, this reflects Master’s statement that all of life’s experiences are for our “education and entertainment.” God dreams a particular dream for each of us, and arranges the events in life for our benefit. Though it’s often hard to see in the midst of suffering, His only motive is the deepest love and concern for our welfare and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get caught up in the pleasure or pain in life, it’s good to remember that we’re not really in charge of our circumstances. We’re only playing our part in God’s dream—be it one of success or failure; health or sickness; love or rejection. With compassion and wisdom God gives to us the roles we are to play, perfectly designed for what we need to learn in this lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So try to release the anxiety over what has happened in the past, what choices you need to make now, and what the future holds. Let God take charge of your life, for, in fact, He already has. Try to see, in every person and every event in your life, the Dreamer behind the dream. Behind the light and shadows of life is only one reality: God’s joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll close with a selection from one of Master’s most beautiful poems, “When I Am Only a Dream”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I come to tell you all of Him,
And the way to encase Him in your bosom,
And of the discipline that brings His grace. . . .
And yet when I am only a dream to you,
I will come to remind you that you too are naught
But a dream of my Heavenly Beloved;
And when you know you are a dream,
As I know now,
We will be ever awake in Him.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;With love and joy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bridging Time and Tranquility</title>
      <link>https://ananda.email/posts/bridging-time-and-tranquility/</link>

      <description>A common problem is carving out time for meditation. This challenge isn’t exclusive to novices—even seasoned meditators can find it tough to dedicate as much time as they would like.
And even on days when we’re not immediately pressed for time, the mental habit of anxiety over it, in addition to the many other stresses in our lives, can keep us from relaxing into the deeper states of tranquility and joy that we seek.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A common problem is carving out time for meditation. This challenge isn’t exclusive to novices—even seasoned meditators can find it tough to dedicate as much time as they would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even on days when we’re not immediately pressed for time, the mental habit of anxiety over it, in addition to the many other stresses in our lives, can keep us from relaxing into the deeper states of tranquility and joy that we seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the solution? Here is a ten-step program that might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just start.&lt;/strong&gt; Swami Kriyananda would often say, “You spend five minutes a day on oral hygiene, can’t you also spend five minutes a day on spiritual hygiene?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a minimum&lt;/strong&gt; Decide on a doable minimum and steadfastly refuse to fall short. For many years, I’ve maintained a minimum number of Kriyas for my morning and evening meditations. Once your commitment is firm, the universe itself will lend a hand to help you reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be regular.&lt;/strong&gt; Find a time that is under your control, often right after you get up, or before going to bed. Then cultivate a habit of meditating at that time. Habits can be formidable allies or dangerous foes. Consistency lays the foundation for your practice without which your commitment will always be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a new habit takes time and tenacity. Whenever I’m trying to create a new habit, I set aside a week or a month during which I refuse to waver. Life will test your resolution, but if you persevere it will get easier. A regular habit of meditation will pay vast dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use aids.&lt;/strong&gt; When my schedule threatens to override my determination, I will set a timer. It helps keep me honest and resolute. A friend who had a difficult time getting up in the morning used to turn on a flashlight and roll it away from his bed. Some people find that a meditation buddy is the solution. Be creative in finding things that help keep you consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/bridging-time-and-tranquility.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;bridging time and tranquility&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality&lt;/strong&gt; is more important than quantity. Quality comes, not by greater effort, but by sustaining focus for longer and longer periods of time. While meditating, pour your whole heart into it. You have the whole rest of the day to wrestle with your pressures and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move beyond body-consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt; The purpose of meditation is to loosen the ego’s grip, which binds the soul to the body and personality. Completely relax the body, then try to feel yourself as energy. As your meditation deepens, identify with your universal soul qualities—light, love, peace, joy—rather than that which separates you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chant more.&lt;/strong&gt; Paramhansa Yogananda said, “Chanting is half the battle.” Many chants are lofty aspirations paired with melody and rhythm. Take, for instance, the simple chant, “I Want Only Thee, Lord, Thee Only Thee.” Repeating this affirmation can gradually make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender everything to God.&lt;/strong&gt; Mental turmoil originates from the likes and dislikes in the heart. Offering everything you have and are to God helps calm and uplift the heart. The mind will then follow suit. That which is given to God becomes beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a woman who had such beautiful hands that they were often photographed by advertisers. Edgar Cayce, a great mystic and seer, said it was because in a past life she had spent many years devotedly scrubbing the floors of her monastery. Give your voice to God and it will become sweet. Give your money to the Divine and you will always have what you need. Yogananda recommended repeating, “I go forth in perfect faith in the power of Omnipresent Good to give me what I need at the time I need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End your meditation by feeling joy.&lt;/strong&gt; Consistently practicing this simple step will make your meditations sweeter, deeper, and more joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carry your peace into daily activities.&lt;/strong&gt; Meditation time will always be limited compared with the rest of the day. If you carry the peace and joy of meditation into your daily activities, you will find your life becoming transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially when time is short, try these simple suggestions. Even a little dose of meditation is the right medication for a stressful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll end with this lovely quote from Swami Kriyananda: “If we enter the clear river flowing majestically to the sea of cosmic consciousness, we find ourselves carried along with increasing ease. At no point do we need to do all the work of swimming ourselves. Ultimately, the current carries us to oneness with Infinite Bliss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In joy,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons Learned Along the Way</title>

      <description>Today marks my fifty-sixth anniversary of meeting Swami Kriyananda in 1967. I knocked on his apartment door in San Francisco soon after reading Autobiography of a Yogi, and he welcomed me not only into his home, but also into his life. While the lessons I’ve learned along the way are too many to list, I’d like to share some of the most significant ones with you.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Today marks my fifty-sixth anniversary of meeting Swami Kriyananda in 1967. I knocked on his apartment door in San Francisco soon after reading &lt;em&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi&lt;/em&gt;, and he welcomed me not only into his home, but also into his life. While the lessons I’ve learned along the way are too many to list, I’d like to share some of the most significant ones with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/lessons-learned-along-the-way.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;lessons learned along the way&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are more important than things:&lt;/strong&gt; After we introduced ourselves he said, “I’m working on a project. Would you like to help?” He needed assistance with a mailing and, naturally, I agreed. Over the years, I’ve often joked that I didn’t realize the project would still be going on more than a half-century later. However, I eventually realized that the project was never about the mailing, or even about helping with Ananda. The real project was &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Swamiji’s primary work was not writing, or lecturing, or building communities. It was the more difficult and subtle task of guiding me and countless others on the journey of self-transformation. The projects were just the wheel on which we honed our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say YES to Life:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the title of Swamiji’s first album, and a major theme of his life. His ability to say “yes” was infectious and magical. I remember the day that he persuaded a small group of us to rent a forty-four-room mansion for an ashram in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood. As he described the possibilities, people gradually shifted from a state of shock at the mere idea, to grudging acceptance, and finally to an eager discussion of each room’s use. The prototype of city communities was born that day. Swami understood that acting with enthusiasm allows the power of the universe to amplify our self-effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy is the solution, not the reward:&lt;/strong&gt; A common mistake is to fixate on the goal, believing that happiness is the prize for achievement. Swamiji, however, taught us to work with joy, to enjoy the journey, not just the destination. Otherwise we become parched travelers trudging through a barren desert, thirsting for an oasis. Swamiji’s solution: carry a canteen filled with liquid joy along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine friendship is God’s love in action:&lt;/strong&gt; Swamiji rarely criticized anyone. Instead he showered us with kindness and support, helping us to overcome our limitations. He set the bar high enough to challenge us, but never so high that we couldn’t reach it. Paramhansa Yogananda said, “If you do one one-hundredth of what I ask, you will get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of life is to dissolve the ego:&lt;/strong&gt; Swami reminded us that life is a quest for the Infinite. Attunement, service to the guru, and self-offering are ways of achieving this goal. He often said, “When I die, I want to be known simply as a good disciple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the journey for you and me is that there is no you and me. In that vein, I’d like to share this lovely and appropriate poem by Khalil Gibran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;It is said that before entering the sea a river trembles with fear.
She looks back at the path she has traveled,
rom the peaks of the mountains,
the long winding road crossing forests and villages.

And in front of her,
she sees an ocean so vast,
that to enter there
seems nothing more than to disappear forever.

But there is no other way.
The river can not go back.

Nobody can go back.
To go back is impossible in existence.

The river needs to take the risk
of entering the ocean
because only then will fear disappear,
because that’s where the river will know
it’s not about disappearing into the ocean,
but of becoming the ocean.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on my long, winding road, I am infinitely grateful that I had Swami Kriyananda walking by my side. And he is still there, ever guiding me to the ocean of Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In gratitude,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Jyotish&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Joy I Live</title>
      <link>https://ananda.email/posts/in-joy-i-live/</link>

      <description>Anyone who has tried to have a regular practice of meditation knows that it’s no easy thing. Creating time in the midst of daily demands, leaving behind worries and preoccupations, summoning up enthusiasm every day: All of these and more are challenges we all face.
What I’d like to do is to walk you through a three-step process that may help you find renewed focus, energy, and enthusiasm for meditation.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tried to have a regular practice of meditation knows that it’s no easy thing. Creating time in the midst of daily demands, leaving behind worries and preoccupations, summoning up enthusiasm every day: All of these and more are challenges we all face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d like to do is to walk you through a three-step process that may help you find renewed focus, energy, and enthusiasm for meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step One:&lt;/strong&gt; Before sitting down to meditate, become aware of the thoughts and feelings that are running through your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Are you feeling rushed, and thinking, “I’ll get this over quickly”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Decide how much time you have, and be fully present for each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Is your body feeling tense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Try doing some pranayamas or a few yoga asanas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Are you feeling discouraged, or that you’ll never be able to meditate deeply?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: This feeling of failure is probably present in everyone who takes up meditation. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says to Arjuna: “But if you cannot think of Me, then give Me your intention.” Begin each meditation with the thought, “Today I give You the best effort of which I am capable.” Don’t look back or forward, but just offer God your intention to try your best today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/in-joy-i-live.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;in joy i live&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Two:&lt;/strong&gt; As you begin to meditate, immediately bring your full, focused energy to the spiritual eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Does your mind quickly revert to daily activities and problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Start with repeating or chanting with concentration the words from Master’s poem, “Samadhi”: “From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Do you find that when you make an intense effort your body gets tense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t look for results; remember, simply, that this is your time with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Become aware of where you’re holding tension, then inhale, tense, and consciously relax those body parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Do you hold the subconscious thought that you’ll never achieve your goals for meditation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Don’t look for results; remember, simply, that this is your time with God. In his book Secrets of Meditation, Swami Kriyananda writes: “The secret of meditation is to pray with deep faith—not as an outsider to heaven, but as one whose true, eternal home is heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also writes: “The secret of meditation is affirming that you already are those high truths towards which you aspire: inner peace, divine love, and perfect joy.” Try to feel that everything you are seeking is already within you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Three:&lt;/strong&gt; After you finish meditation, throughout the day try to hold on to the feelings of peace that you experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: Do you leap into activities as soon as you finish meditation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Build a bridge between meditation and activity. Consciously do simple activities, such as making your bed, during which you keep your mind calm and centered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: As challenges arise during the day, do you fall into negative emotions and reactions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Keep the peace of meditation as a constant reference point throughout the day. If you feel yourself getting agitated, immediately try to direct your energy to the spiritual eye until you feel calmness restored. You can also bring to mind again Master’s words: “From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk the spiritual path, it’s hard to see changes in ourselves, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t growing. Once Swamiji was discussing the progress that various Ananda members had made. Almost unaware of what I was saying, I blurted out, “I don’t see that I’ve changed all that much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great intensity, he said, “How can you say that? You’re an entirely different person than when you came.” This is true of anyone who sincerely tries their best to meditate and follow the spiritual path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s meditate with joy, live in joy, and eagerly anticipate the day when we melt in joy once more. And in our love for God, offer to Him the fruits of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With joy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Behind the Stern Facade</title>

      <description>We recently heard a remarkable story about Sri Yukteswar. Many devotees have a little difficulty relating to him, since he seems a bit forbidding. Perhaps it is because in Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda writes about him in his role as both teacher and disciplinarian, a job he took very seriously, especially knowing that he was preparing Master for a world-changing role.
But the grandson of Tulsi Bose, Master’s close friend, told us that when Sri Yukteswar visited their home he was completely different.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;We recently heard a remarkable story about Sri Yukteswar. Many devotees have a little difficulty relating to him, since he seems a bit forbidding. Perhaps it is because in Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda writes about him in his role as both teacher and disciplinarian, a job he took very seriously, especially knowing that he was preparing Master for a world-changing role.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/behind-the-stern-facade.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;behind the stern facade&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the grandson of Tulsi Bose, Master’s close friend, told us that when Sri Yukteswar visited their home he was completely different. He was a kind, lovable, grandfatherly figure who usually had sweets to offer to the many children who gathered around him. I, myself, had an experience where I felt his sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were about to begin a Kriya Initiation in Chennai, India, and the pictures on the altar were all garlanded. As I was bowing to each of our Masters, I mentally prayed to Sri Yukteswar to help me relate to him more deeply. The instant the prayer formed in my mind, the garland around his photo fell off, and I was given the opportunity to lovingly re-garland him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, then, is the remarkable story related to us by Nayaswami Aditya, our center leader in Pune:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bhuvan Pal Singh joined the online classes in Pune during the first wave of Covid and became a Kriyaban. I immediately recognized him as someone who felt like an old friend. He was sincere, with deep yearning and humility, and asked many questions to refine his spiritual practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bhuvan’s lifelong yearning had been to leave everything and go to the Himalayas, but he found himself supporting his entire extended family of thirty-five people, something he did quite happily and very well. During the first wave of the pandemic he took retirement from his successful corporate career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Bhuvan began his Kriya practice, he was diagnosed with a rare malignant cancer of the muscles of his right forearm. Expert advice from the best doctors in the country informed him that little could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tears in his eyes Bhuvan related this story: “One day I was undergoing a PET scan to assess the spread of the tumor in my body and found myself alone in a hospital room. As I sat there I prayed to the Masters, “I am feeling very alone.” I instantly had a vision of the form of Sri Yukteswarji in front of me. As his life-size form slowly moved towards me, it shrunk in size until he became very small and entered into my body through my spiritual eye. From within I heard Swami Sri Yukteswarji say, ‘Bhuvan, don’t feel alone or afraid, for I am in every cell of your body.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhuvanji continued his daily Kriya practice, and although he followed the suggested treatments, his health deteriorated over the months and on 26 January 2022 he left his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, his wife, Anupama, had the following experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was awakened early one morning by the sound of the main door of our house being unfastened. As I opened my eyes, I saw a bright yellow light falling on the door, and curious to see what this light was, I moved towards it. Just then I heard and saw my husband, in physical form, seated in the living room in meditative pose, his gaze uplifted. He said to me, ‘Anupama, don’t move. I’m exiting now.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I stood still, and watched my husband exit into that light. A couple of hours after this experience I got a call from my niece in New Delhi. She told me that the previous night she had dreamt that she saw a bright yellow light fall on our house, especially on the main door. In the dream she saw her uncle Bhuvan enter that light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anupama has kindly given Nayaswami Aditya permission, and we thank her for allowing us to share this sacred experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Swamiji’s passing Devi and I had a “Nadi” reading from an ancient book of prophecy. During that reading we were told that Yogananda was watching out for us minute by minute and second by second. This applies to all of us who have opened our hearts to this great line of masters. Yoganandaji, as Swami Kriyananda explained, was a Blissavatar (incarnation of divine joy). Yoganandaji described Sri Yukteswar as a gyanavatar (incarnation of wisdom). In fact, in God’s light all His qualities merge into one, and in our hour of need we, too, will find that God’s light is in every cell of our body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God’s light,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Jyotish&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Sacred Gift</title>

      <description>Devi wrote recently about our pilgrimage to sacred sites in Varanasi, Kolkata, and Serampore. On our last day in Serampore a very special gift was given to us.
This city is on the banks of the Ganges and was the location of Sri Yukteswar’s ashram, where Paramhansa Yogananda spent the better part of ten years in training with his beloved guru. During that period, Yogananda often visited the family of his elder brother, Anantalal Ghosh, who also resided in Serampore.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Devi wrote recently about our pilgrimage to sacred sites in Varanasi, Kolkata, and Serampore. On our last day in Serampore a very special gift was given to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This city is on the banks of the Ganges and was the location of Sri Yukteswar’s ashram, where Paramhansa Yogananda spent the better part of ten years in training with his beloved guru. During that period, Yogananda often visited the family of his elder brother, Anantalal Ghosh, who also resided in Serampore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch with members of the Ghosh family. We have known Durlov and his son Ishan for years, having first met them many years ago with Swami Kriyananda. At the end of the meal we withdrew to a private patio where they presented us with an extremely precious plate that had been in the family for well over one hundred years. Here is a description given to us by Ishan of this sacred relic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The object which we gave you is a plate made of stone. My father heard from his grandmother, that is, the wife of Anantalal Ghosh, that this plate was there when she was married. That means it must have been bought by either Guruji’s parents or someone else in the family in or before the year Anantalal Ghosh was married. Plates like this are usually used in Indian families for offering food to the gods. Usually, they rest at family altars, and so was the case with this plate as well. However, when Paramhansa Yogananda became a sanyasi, it was not possible for him to accept food at home, since all of the kitchen plates were somehow in touch with meat or fish. Therefore, he was offered food instead on plates from the altar; the plates in which food has been offered to the gods; the plate which we gave you. When Paramhansa Yogananda came back to India, he had his meals on these plates as always. This plate has been there in our family for more than a hundred years, and we gifted it to you since we feel that more people should have the opportunity to drink from its spiritual vibrations. We are so pleased that the gods gave us the opportunity to forward such priceless spiritual vibrations into your hands. We are so pleased that you accepted it with such deep reverence and joy.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/a-sacred-gift.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;a sacred gift&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Presently the plate rests on the lap of a statue of Master that sits in our meditation room in Delhi. We will soon place it along with other sacred objects where visitors and pilgrims can meditate and feel the holy vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plate also embodies a deep spiritual lesson for us all. Food is a symbol of the gift of life from Divine Mother, and Yogananda would only eat if the food had first been offered back to God. But everything is a gift from Divine Mother, and God-offering should be applied to all aspects of life. Yogananda spoke of this truth poetically in his beautiful poem “God! God! God!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first rise from slumber, the day ahead should be offered to God. When we break our fast, we should be aware that the very food we eat is a form of Divine Mother. If, during our working hours, the spotlight of our mind ever keeps returning to God, our work can be transformed into sacred service. Giving God our worries, our memories, and our dreams transforms the mundane into the sacred. Ultimately, it is our love above all that must be purified through offering it to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, all that we “own,” and all that we think we “are,” must be offered into God’s light. He will receive our offerings, purify them, and then playfully join us in a life free from attachment to the delusion of “I” and “mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t is interesting that the essence of the spiritual path is somehow magically condensed into a single sacred plate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Celebration of God</title>
      <link>https://ananda.email/posts/a-celebration-of-god/</link>

      <description>A small group of us just returned from a glorious trip to Varanasi, Kolkata, and Serampore—all places known for their holiness, and filled with events sacred to our line of gurus. Everywhere we saw and experienced the joyful celebration of God in many things that is characteristic of life in India, a celebration not somber and serious, but filled with exuberance.
The evening we arrived in Varanasi, we visited the ashram of Ananda Moyi Ma, the great woman saint about whom Yoganandaji writes in Autobiography of a Yogi.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A small group of us just returned from a glorious trip to Varanasi, Kolkata, and Serampore—all places known for their holiness, and filled with events sacred to our line of gurus. Everywhere we saw and experienced the joyful celebration of God in many things that is characteristic of life in India, a celebration not somber and serious, but filled with exuberance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening we arrived in Varanasi, we visited the ashram of Ananda Moyi Ma, the great woman saint about whom Yoganandaji writes in &lt;em&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi&lt;/em&gt;. We meditated there on the balcony overlooking the Ganges next to the room where Ma did puja to her beloved image of Krishna, and in her small bedroom. As we sat quietly, a small boy appeared and began doing cartwheels, laughing all the while. How pleased Ma must have been, I thought, to have so much joy expressed before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early the next morning we visited the home of Lahiri Mahasaya, where he lived, initiated people into Kriya, and left his body. Though the building is locked, there is a large stone bench across the narrow lane on which we sat to meditate. Despite the steady stream of people walking to work, children on their way to school, and noisy motorcycles, we felt a deep inner stillness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, I opened my eyes to see that many of those passing by stopped at Lahiri’s door and touched it to take his blessings. A motorcycle driven by a father with his three children on their way to school also stopped, and each one took blessings. What a wonderful way to start the school day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our time in Kolkata was one long celebration with Yoganandaji and his disciples. Our wonderful center leaders there, Dithi and Alok, along with a team of devotees, have renovated the house of Master’s boyhood friend, Tulsi Bose. It’s quite near to Master’s family home, and it is at the Bose house that Guruji spent most of his days as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made holy by visits from great saints like Sri Yukteswar, Ananda Moyi Ma, and Vivekananda, and by the many holy relics from Babaji and our line of gurus, the house is beautifully kept now, with all the relics carefully placed in glass cases. Here we all chanted and meditated with the Kolkata devotees, and felt awash with joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we stopped at the Ghosh family home at 4 Gurpar Road, and were lovingly hosted by Master’s great-nephew, Somnath, and his wife Sarita. After meditating in the little attic room where Yoganandaji tells us he “first found God,” we were served a delicious homemade lunch. One of our group said, “It felt like a family reunion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few more days of public events in Kolkata, we took a beautiful boat ride on the Ganges at twilight to Serampore. It is here, on the riverbank, that the banyan tree still stands where Babaji appeared to Sri Yukteswar and where Sri Yukteswar’s ashram is located. As we walked to our hotel, we stopped to pray at the holy tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time of year, it is customary to celebrate Durga Puja, a ten-day holiday in honor of Durga, the goddess of strength, determination, victory, and wisdom. As part of the festival, large images of Durga are fashioned out of clay, beautifully painted and decorated, and then immersed in the Ganges to let her dissolve back into the Infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we prayed at the banyan tree, many groups of people carrying their images of Durga released her into the river lovingly, laughingly, joyfully. What a beautiful moment it was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many blessings have come thus far on our trip, but the main insight I want to share with you is this: The path to God can be a celebration, a joyful release of all that we are into the infinite arms of God. Yes, we need determination to continue, but don’t forget to celebrate God’s presence every step of the way. This is what draws us closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With joy and blessings to you,&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>“If you only knew how much God loved you, you would die for joy.” These words from St. Jean Vianney, a French saint of the nineteenth century, have always inspired and motivated me spiritually.
Jyotish and I are visiting Ananda’s community and retreat center outside of Assisi now, and are staying in the lovely guest apartment of two good friends, Shantidev and Radhika. On the wall in one of the rooms is a print of a beautiful Indian painting called, “Enter the Spiritual World.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;“If you only knew how much God loved you, you would die for joy.” These words from St. Jean Vianney, a French saint of the nineteenth century, have always inspired and motivated me spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://ananda.email/img/if-you-only-knew.jpeg&#34;  alt=&#34;if you only knew&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 7px; width: 100%;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jyotish and I are visiting Ananda’s community and retreat center outside of Assisi now, and are staying in the lovely guest apartment of two good friends, Shantidev and Radhika. On the wall in one of the rooms is a print of a beautiful Indian painting called, “Enter the Spiritual World.” It depicts Krishna tenderly embracing one of his devotees in a pastoral setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Shantidev what the story was behind the painting, and here is what he recounted. The devotee being embraced is Gopal Kumar, who, in a past incarnation, had been one of the gopis with Krishna in Brindaban. Through subsequent lives of spiritual seeking, Gopal Kumar had become a great yogi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he had reached the stage where all he wanted was to achieve union with God. In his quest he traveled throughout the three worlds—causal, astral, and physical—to find what he was seeking. Still, his life’s burning goal eluded him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally he arrived in Goloka Brindaban, the dimension where Krishna resides in the spiritual realm. Here, after many incarnations of separation, he beheld Krishna once again. There was an immediate mutual recognition; Krishna enfolded his dear devotee, Gopal Kumar, in a loving embrace. And just then, to everyone’s alarm, Krishna fainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the devotees gasped, not knowing what had befallen their beloved Lord. They fanned him and rubbed his feet, and eventually Krishna returned to consciousness. He explained that he had been so full of ecstasy and joy to meet Gopal Kumar again after their long separation that he had lost consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful thought to reflect upon: &lt;em&gt;that God is even more ecstatic than we are when one of His lost children returns home&lt;/em&gt;. Jean Vianney described the transcendent joy that comes to that devotee who knows God’s love, and Krishna shows us the completion of divine union: God’s joy is even greater than our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is life’s tests and challenges that help us to feel God’s love more deeply. Recently while in Assisi, Jyotish and I contracted Covid, which fortunately was a very mild case. Now we are almost totally recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our illness, we received such an outpouring of love, support, and prayers from friends around the world that we were deeply touched. As we read the many notes, we were moved at how God’s love for us is sometimes expressed outwardly through divine friendship. Often when we need it the most, we get glimpses of how much we are loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Gopal Kumar, let’s continue on our journey to find Oneness with God. One day, we will know the fullness of His love and merge with it into ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend in God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nayaswami Devi&lt;/p&gt;
